# AI Agent Development with LangGraph - Multi-Tool Conversational Assistant
## Description:
Developed an intelligent conversational agent using LangGraph framework that integrates multiple tools for enhanced functionality. The project features a stateful graph-based architecture that combines a Groq LLM (Llama-3.1-8b-instant) with external tools including Tavily web search and custom mathematical functions.

## Key Technical Achievements:
- Implemented modular architecture with separate components for state management, model configuration, and tool definitions
- Built a conditional routing system that intelligently decides between tool execution and direct responses
- Integrated real-time web search capabilities for current information retrieval
- Designed stateful conversation management using LangGraph's message handling system
- Created a visual graph representation of the agent's decision flow using Mermaid diagrams

## Technologies Used: 
Python, LangGraph, LangChain, Groq API, Tavily Search API, TypedDict for state management

## Outcome: 
Successfully created a functional AI assistant capable of handling complex multi-step queries that require both web research and computational tasks, demonstrating proficiency in modern AI agent development patterns and tool integration.
